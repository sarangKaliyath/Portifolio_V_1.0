                My name is Sarang Kaliyath. Started as an Electrical engineer
                but soon found the light in web development.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's barely been a minute since I have started learning to code,
                building simple real-world apps is something I duly cherish.
              </p>

              <p>
                To quote Steve Jobs “The only way to do great work is to love
                what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t
                settle.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I am diligently looking for opportunities to work as a web
                developer.
